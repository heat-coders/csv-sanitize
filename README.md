# CSV Transaction Sanitizer

A simple, elegant web application that sanitizes CSV files by converting transaction names from ALL CAPS to proper sentence case. Perfect for cleaning up financial transaction data exported from banks and financial institutions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Simply drag your CSV file onto the upload area
- **Smart Sanitization**: Converts ALL CAPS transaction names to proper sentence case
- **Real-time Processing**: See progress as your file is processed
- **Instant Download**: Get your sanitized CSV file immediately
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **No Data Upload**: All processing happens in your browser - your data never leaves your device

## üìã How It Works

The application specifically targets the **first column** of your CSV file (typically the transaction description) and:

1. Converts ALL CAPS text to sentence case
2. Preserves special characters, numbers, and punctuation
3. Maintains proper formatting for contractions and possessives
4. Keeps all other columns unchanged

### Example Transformations

| Before (ALL CAPS) | After (Sentence Case) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `WALMART SUPERCENTER` | `Walmart Supercenter` |
| `AMAZON.COM PURCHASE` | `Amazon.com Purchase` |
| `SHELL GAS STATION #123` | `Shell Gas Station #123` |
| `MCDONALD'S #4567` | `Mcdonald's #4567` |
| `ATM WITHDRAWAL FEE` | `Atm Withdrawal Fee` |
